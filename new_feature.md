I decided to vamp up the second project from the homework which was the to do list. The new feature I was trying to add was the ability to customize the color scheme of the website. I had already added a feature where the user can change the color of the background and container, this new feature would have set color schemes and everything would change color. This is a reasonable feature to expect in a frontend project because the theme switching and instant style changing is done in CSS and then some JavaScript to remember the user's selection. ChatGpt was very successful in implementing changes I prompted it. I honoeslty think that there was too much code and that is why ChatGPT was unsuccessful. ChatGPT would come up with a whole reasoning and plan before implementing changes to the code, this part was successful, but when it would spit out the code I was supposed to use, a lot of the previous functionality was destroyed. I tried to be explicit about leaving the rest as is and just adding in the new feature, but it would still mess everything previous up. I attached a fail file as well to show how the website functioned after ChatGPT tried to implement the color schemes.
